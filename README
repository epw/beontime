This project contains the development files for the Be On Time Android
application.

The primary code is in the BeOnTime/ directory, and can be compiled
for testing with "and debug install." Experimental code for the games
used by Be On Time are in their own directories, with main() methods
to allow them to be run from a PC.

Be On Time is currently targetted at the Level 10 APIs, for Android
2.3.3.

To test Be On Time, change to the BeOnTime/ directory, start an
Android emulator or attach a debugging-enabled Android phone, and run
	$ ant debug install
and the "Be On Time" app should be added.

ACTIVITIES

Be On Time is based around four major activities.

Running Be On Time starts the EventChooser activity. This presents a
list of events from the user's calendar, allowing any of them to be
selected.
