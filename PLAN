RATIONAL
I am rarely on time, because I leave too late. A game with
the side-effect of making me leave earlier would be valuable.

OVERVIEW
The game would be written for GPS-enabled mobile devices. It
would be designed to be played in very small, high-reward bursts. The
specifics of the game can vary, and in fact a framework which
supports multiple games can be written would be ideal.

The game would use your location. When you move more than (a given
amount expected from movement within a location) and then stop, the
game unlocks and allows you to play for a few minutes.
